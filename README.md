# Electric-Machines
This repository contains simulations of various motors. As of current, just SwitchedReluctanceMotor has been added. More models will be added in future; feel free to contribute with simulation of any other electric machine not yet covered.

### SwitchedReluctanceMotor

Reluctance motor is a kind of stepper motor that runs by reluctance torque. Switched Reluctance Motor uses electrical control system for precisely timed current switching in the stator.

To see the demonstration of its characteristic curves, open the SwitchedReluctanceMotor simulink and test with the following:

  - Change firing angles (a & B) and see the resulting effect on speed, torque and current.
  - Change the current input from top-left module.
  - Change the model of motor from specific (current) to generic.
  - Change the construction of motor
